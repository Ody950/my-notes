# Lab 01
---
### Introduction 

I am *Odai Al-Obeidat*, I graduated with a ba*ch*elor's degree in ***civil engineering*** in 2017. In the following years, I studied a Ma**st**er's degree in ***Business Administration***, which I completed last year. Over the past few years, I have worked for a number of companies specializing in logistics services.I was rejected both times. To me, this course serves as a gateway to the administrative side of the field.
